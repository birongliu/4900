    "descriptionText": "This gorgeous girl is MIA, a 7-8 month old, 45 pound, American Pit Bull Terrier mix with one blue eye and one brown eye. Mia&rsquo;s fur is a beautiful golden brown with white. Mia is an amazing puppy who knows no stranger. She loves all people, young and old, and is fantastic with dogs of all sizes. Despite her size, Mia is a BIG cuddler and thinks she's a lap dog; she is happy to climb into your lap and take a nap there.\nSince living in foster care, Mia has learned to ring a bell to go outside and has learned to walk nicely on a leash. Mia loves toys! She regularly pulls them out of the toy box with which to play. She shares toys very easily with the other dogs in her foster home. Mia also likes to play fetch, bringing the ball back and dropping it for another round. Mia is a smart, obedient, wonderful dog!!\nBecause Mia is a puppy, she requires an adopter who will dedicate time and effort to Mia so she continues with her basic manners. It would be best if Mia&rsquo;s adopter can come home mid-day so that she have a potty break. Mia is an awesome puppy who enjoys playing games, getting and giving cuddles, chasing toys, and spending time with her favorite people and other dogs.\nThis dog has received veterinary exams, age appropriate inoculations, been tested for parasites, dewormed, placed on monthly heartworm preventative, spayed, and microchipped. ADOPTION APPLICATIONS are available for online completion and submission through our website - www.acaringplacehs.org",

He also loves to sun bathe in the yard or next to your sunny patio door. Coco is crate trained and Potty pad trained but he really would like to go outside to do his business. He loves to be held and loved on, but then he also loves to play with you and his toys. Coco is very curious and will watch you to see what you are doing or bringing into the house. He doesn&rsquo;t mind the cats and leaves them alone as long as they don&rsquo;t take his toys. Coco is still a baby and requires a lot more training and love, will that be you.

I'm a DELIGHTFUL young Lady who just loooooooves belly rubs! Mare says I'm a SWEETIE, claiming I&rsquo;m nothing but solid love through and through and by far one of the easiest dogs she's EVER had the pleasure of hosting ~ pretty HIGH praise coming from someone who's known to be sooooo picky about behavior, believe me!!! I really enjoy being with nice people and all the fun dogs here, and I especially looooooove, Luv, LOVE the children that visit! I am sooooooo very grateful to have this opportunity to experience how wonderful life can be! I&rsquo;m EASY GOING, laid back and always display impeccable manners both indoors AND outside. I enjoy long walks, evening strolls down quiet streets, playing with other dogs and children, riding in the car, hiking and/or doing just about anything that makes you happy so that we can spend family time together! I'm also house, car, crate and leash trained; sitting on cue (instantly and without being asked, thank you very much) and walking politely on lead as a genteel girl should. I&rsquo;m a VERY SWEET, gentle soul who lives to please my people so I long to find that special person(s) who will appreciate my GENTLE, giving personality and the life time of love and devotion I&rsquo;ll shower YOU with in return!\nWhy wait???

I&rsquo;m a 1 year old American Staffordshire Terrier and soooooo WELL BEHAVED that I'm learning quickly to become the consummate Lady ~ a title I crave! I do enjoy frolicking with my human and canine friends outdoors though I behave with proper decorum and perfect manners at all times ~ one must set a good example for their breed you know. I consider getting dirty or misbehaving as beneath my character, keeping myself clean and correct in every setting. If you like walks or hiking then I&rsquo;m your girl, exercise is something I believe in to maintain my PERFECT figure! I enjoy all my friends at our multi dog indoor foster home and am gracious to everyone I meet, it ALWAYS pays to be a gracious Lady. Typical of the Amstaff breeding, I have a stable, even temperament, am calm, HIGHLY INTELLIGENT, easy to train, AFFECTIONATE, very GENTLE and extremely well behaved indoors knowing that&rsquo;s the place to be kicked back. I&rsquo;m a very SWEET girl who has lived in an indoor home my entire life so I'm super well socialized, housebroken, crate trained and even sit (automatically, thank you) for treats. I love to play with toys, other dogs, human children and especially enjoy car rides! I have a heart of gold, and I'm FABULOUS with children because I love humans of all sizes. I learn new lessons extremely fast and love to please, especially in response to an experienced, calm, assertive pack leader that I respect. My foster Mom says I&rsquo;m the perfect breed ambassador, absolutely amazing to work with and an exceptional companion with a personality as LOVELY as my looks ~ how very nice of her to notice MY pawstive attributes!Why wait???

He is working on his housebreaking and doing good with consistency. Bambino is a little guy, with tons of love to share. Bambino is looking for a home with a yard and maybe a canine sibling. \nBambino's adoption fee: $250",

    "descriptionText": "Hi, my name's Keisha! I&rsquo;m 2 year old spayed female Yellow Lab mix who's known to be a HAPPY, healthy, outgoing, SUPER SMART, well mannered and very AFFECTIONATE young Lady who's totally ready to find my fur~ever home. I absolutely love to play with other dogs and humans (if someone initiates the game, pays to mind one's manners ya know) and I've completely mastered the &ldquo;sit&rdquo;, &ldquo;stay&rdquo;, &ldquo;wait&rdquo; and &ldquo;load up&rdquo; commands plus I&rsquo;m even spotlessly house and crate trained ~ and even leash trained too ~ putting my head right through the loop and walking out nicely on lead to go for another adventure! I&rsquo;m a VERY FRIENDLY girl who loves to run and play outside with humans or dogs and am very WELL BEHAVED indoors, settling in nicely at your feet so we can read, nap or watch movies. I also love long walks or hikes with my favorite human(s), or just about anything you care to do that lets us spend time together. I do very well with other dogs, playing with all my friends in an indoor multi dog foster home because I truly enjoy their company ~ so much so in fact that my rescue friends have promised to find me a home with a nice male canine companion to share my life with ! I&rsquo;d make a FABULOUS addition to any family looking to add another member to their pack. I&rsquo;m a SWEETHEART who loves to please her people and is eager to learn new things. I&rsquo;d really like to have a special person(s) of my very own, one who&rsquo;ll fulfill my dream of having a pack leader who'll teach me new things and maybe even take me to classes where I can show off OUR talents. Could you, would YOU be MY new fur~ever friends ?!?Why wait??? Contact us via our petabulls.com website or simply call Mare at (505)316-2089 for a private \"By Appointment Only\" showing at our weekly \"Adoptions in the Park\" !!!",

I&rsquo;m a super friendly, lovable clown that adores hugs and frolicking with my human and canine friends. Mare says she fell in love with my lively eyes and goofy grins, you can just see the LOADS of character in my silly facial expressions. She tells everyone that I&rsquo;m nothing but solid love and laughter through and through cause I&rsquo;m ALWAYS happy, smiling and FULL of life ~ just look at my photos ~ I smile ALL the time !!! While we realize this listing indicates I'm an American Staffordshire Terrier (there's no designation for my breed in the listing programs yet), I'm really a pure bred &ldquo;American Bully&rdquo;! We're a newer, special, improved version of the Bully breedings via the Gotti and Razor's Edge bloodlines. As typically noted in the American Bully's, I have a SUPER stable, even temperament so I'm CALM, highly intelligent, EASY to train, super AFFECTIONATE, extremely GENTLE and very WELL BEHAVED indoors knowing that's the place to be kicked back. I&rsquo;m a calm, QUIET, gentle young Lady who has spent her entire life in an indoor home so I&rsquo;m easy going indoors (and out) and always display impeccable manners, lounging quietly at your feet with a favorite bone to be the perfect companion. If you like walks, hiking or running, I&rsquo;m your girl ~ the consummate athlete with &ldquo;PERFECT pace&rdquo; for all you runners out there! I&rsquo;m a very sweet girl who&rsquo;s super socialized, housebroken, crate (though I certainly don&rsquo;t require one), car and leash trained: walking very politely on lead as a true lady should. And, I even sit nicely for treats (immediately AND without being asked, thank you very much :) I love to play with toys, fetch the ball and especially enjoy touring in an automobile, playing with children and engaging in just about anything that makes you happy so that we can spend family time together! I have a heart of gold, and am super good with children because I love humans of all sizes but&nbsp;careful with the cats or small furry creatures cause ones that ruuuuun can look a bit like interactive play toys to my semi puppy eyes :) I learn really quickly and love to please, especially in response to an experienced, calm, assertive pack leader that I respect. Mare says I&rsquo;m the PERFECT companion because I have a heart as BIG as all outdoors. I long to find that special person(s) who will appreciate my lovely personality and the life time of devotion I will gladly give them in return!Why wait???

Sarge is potty trained and is crated 9.5 hours each work day. He uses and requires durable dog toys to keep him occupied during that time. He is not kenneled during the night, sleeps in the bedroom on his doggie bed. &nbsp;Sarge needs a little work on how to meet other dogs because he is so friendly some dogs are nervous. &nbsp;He is doing better but still needs coaching meeting new people outside of the home.&nbsp;&nbsp; Does well at home where he feels comfortable. \nSarge's ideal home will have a securely fenced yard to keep him safely at home.&nbsp; Please&nbsp; fill out an&nbsp;ADOPTION or FOSTER APPLICATION&nbsp;by clicking on the FOSTER or ADOPT button below.

Do you like kisses? I like giving kisses. In fact, I am such\n\na loving boy that some humans get tired of my kisses. How is that\n\npossible???\n\n\nMy name is Dakota and my nickname is Bubba. I must be pretty special\n\n\nto have TWO names! Well actually I am very special in many ways. I have an incredible story actually and I am very lucky to have be alive after the hardship I endured long ago. Thankfully my days of neglect ended when I was swept up by loving people and properly treated for a simple medical condition\n&nbsp;called&nbsp;Diabetes Insipidus. I am on a low cost daily medication that involves giving me&nbsp;eye drops 2 times a day, Yep that is it and the best part is it costs less then 40$ a month. Its really no issue at all and I am very healthy overall.&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay so now on to the good stuff......\n\n\n\n\nI love making new friends, especially at the dog\n\n\npark. I don&#39;t run a lot because I get tired easily but I do like to\n\nshow the little puppies how things work in our doggie world. I like to\n\nshow them the ropes. I can never have enough friends, although I\n\nsometimes find it hard to share my toys. I&#39;m used to being the only\n\ndog in the house but my cousins and I play well together when we\n\nvisit. The littlest cousin is a girl and we like to hangout and chill.\n\nMy other cousin is a young lab and he is too hyper for me.\n\nOccasionally I have to yell at him to settle down.\n\n\nMy favorite treats are dried sweet potatoes, but really I like all\n\nfoods. Yogurt, peanut butter and chicken are some of my favorites. I\n\nlove long walks on chilly days. My thick double coat is warm and my\n\npaws are perfect for playing in the snow! I love Minnesota winters! I\n\nenjoy being outside but not on really hot days, then I just want to\n\nstay in the cool air conditioning and lay on my blanket. I don&#39;t\n\ntypically jump onto the couch either, I prefer the cool floor.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;",
